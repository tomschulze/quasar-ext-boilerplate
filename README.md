Boilerplate code for developing quasar app extensions with vite instead of webpack. Adopted from `yarn create quasar` ui kit scaffolding.

## TODO
* [ ] include `dev` in `ui` so a ui build is not necessary to watch changes in `quasar dev`, however that requires bundling exercises with vite

## Structure
* [/ui](ui) - standalone npm package

* [/app-extension](app-extension) - Quasar app extension

* [/dev](dev) - Playground
